    	<h1>Education in kenya during the Covid-19 pandemic</h1>
<p>The country is in a critical state now.The pandemic has brought about the closure of schools making it hard for both the students and parents.The livelihood has become so hard that people can not afford three meals per day. The students that were meant to graduate this year, the form four and class eight graduates most of them are hopeless.Parents need to talk to their children since most of them are suffering emotionally and this could bring about suicidal thoughts. What I can advise the students is that life is not a straight path, you will never know what awaits you tomorrow so we should always be open minded and ready for everything. 
There are several activities which our students can involve themselves in. This includes:</p>  

  <h2><u>Artwork</u></h2>

<p>Art is the activity by which a person, having experienced an emotion, intentionally transmits it to others.One can decide to draw, make jewelsand handcrafts.Students can spend their time doing this when the schools have been closed.This can help them get money,widen their way of thinking and also destract them from drugs and which has effects like immorality.</p> 

<h2><u>Poetry</u></h2>


<p>Poetry is a form of expression. Writing it will let us   get out our feelings and thoughts on a subject while reading it encourages us to connect and find meaning in our experiences. Poetry can have a positive impact on the social and emotional learning of children. It may offer them a new way of thinking about something. Students can express what they feel so that they can ease the pain. Writing is like talking to someone but it is more secure because no one will gossip I feel it more advantegous. </p>

    <h2>Volunteer</h2>
    <p>Find opportunities to volunteer in their community. If there are older people or immunocompromised people help them out. Help out vulnerable people in the community to pick up their groceries and medicine. Healthcare workers around the world are called to work in high demand and they might need your help looking after their children or looking after their parents while they attend to life-saving work in clinics and hospitals around the world. </p>
