      <h1><u><i>Buju Banton Quote</i></u></h1>
      <h3><q><i>When you rent a house you can not change the structure to fit your needs</i></q></h3>

<p>As the saying goes it means that it is for me to fit in the need not the need to fit in me.This can be illustrated in several sectors.There are several heritages from colonialists and some are doing well while others are not. Those who are doing well include:</p>
              <h2>Health</h2> 
<p>Colonialists came to Africa to colonialize us.They found some diseases which they were are unknown to Africans.The exposure of Europeans to the disease prompted their efforts to create the cure which later benefitted Africans. In Kenya we still rely on  European Countries to for medication.This is we because we can not afford to make our own.</p>
            <h2>Railway sector</h2>
  <p>The railway sector was introduced in Kenya by the colonialists.The sector is doing well since the it has been upgraded to a more pennan train.In keeping with its mandate, Kenya Railways is committed to providing the country with safe, reliable and efficient railway transport services. The railways master plan sets out to transform the national railway network through the rolling out of the mass commuter rail system for the country's metropolis and the construction of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) network.</p>

<p>There are other sectors which were introduced in the colonial period but are not doing well as desired.These include:
  <h2>Agriculture</h2>
  The agricultural sector has deteriorated because of coruuption in Kenya. Those in leadership of Agricultural sector are using the public finance to benefit themselves.The tenders are being distributed to friends and family members.A common citizen has to be given an opportunity to terminate such leaders.

<h2>Bad leadership</h2>

<p>Europeans used to mistreat Africans during the colonial period.This has extended upto today Our leaders are dictating us in the name of democracy.All I know is there is dictatorship in Kenya.I Kenya is either what I say or you get hurt or even die. The late Chris Musando during the elections because he negleted the orders he was given and he is not the only one but he is among many others.</p>

               <h2><u>HOPE</u></h2>
<p>If there is something I am sure about is hope.Hope exists.If you are hopeful, you will succeed for sure! Every day comes with chances, every sun rises with new promises. Do not let those slip away from you. Hope for the best and keep moving forward! If you reach a dead end on your journey, hang on there with all your might.I always remind myself that <h3><i>Remember what you want in life thats it.</i></h3>
