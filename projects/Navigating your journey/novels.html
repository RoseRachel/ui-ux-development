    	<h1>THE JOURNEY OF THE AUTHOR</h1>
<p>A journey is traveling from one place to another, usually taking a rather long time; trip: a six-day journey across the desert. a distance, course, or area traveled or suitable for traveling: a desert journey. In this case for me is course.It really takes a big heart to be i technology.You know why? Because challenges come to streghten me but never allowed them to break me down.I learnt that I should never bring the left overs of the previos days to the next day.</p>  

<p>There are times life become so hard that I had to take it easy.I had to encourage myself and take it easy.Yes, it is pothole season – that time of year when gaping holes appear in the road and drivers spend their time maneuvering around them. Seems like everyone is talking about their latest pothole misadventure. That’s because almost anywhere you are driving in the city you are in for some rough road.
</p>
<p>Other than just learning tech there is a take away which I took from AkiraChix. My trainer Veronicah Thamaini thought me several things in life.The topics include:</p>
<h2>Abuse</h2>
<p>Women are abused by their husbands in real life. This is because from African culture, men are seen to be the head of the family while women they have no say towards that. I really find this culture babaric I am for equity we deserve equal rights as men. In workplaces women are sexually harrased they authority never does anything to protect women because like three quarters of the administration are men.This sis related in the book <i>Born a Crime by Trevor Noah</i> . Patricia is in abusive relationship with Abel.Patricia all along has been mistreated by his husband but she never left the home. One day Abel almost killed her when he shoots him on the head.</p>

         <h2>LOVE,STRENGTH AND FAITH</h2>
<p>What is faith? It is a complete trust in someone or something. When I say complete, yes it is complete.When you totally believe in someone or something it strengthens you.I trust that everything with a beginning it has an end.But most importantly let it not end unproductively.Let what you do be at your best so that you can be proud of it. We can see Patricia in the book born a crime, she had faith in God She always took the positive side and approach towards and she also had love for her family.When you love something you will hold on no matter how difficult things are going to be.</p>

 <h2><u>Have hope</u></h2>
<p>If there is something I am sure about is hope.Hope exists.If you are hopeful, you will succeed for sure! Every day comes with chances, every sun rises with new promises. Do not let those slip away from you. Hope for the best and keep moving forward! If you reach a dead end on your journey, hang on there with all your might.I always remind myself that <h3><i>Remember what you want in life thats it.</i></h3>
